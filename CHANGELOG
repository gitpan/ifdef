	Moved the conversion logic to a subroutine.  It will have some effect
	on performance at the expense of better maintainability.  Sorry guys.
	This should allow for a more extensive functionality.

	Added an official API for AUTOLOADing modules: the "process", "reset"
	and "oneline" subroutines.

	Changed name to "ifdef" after a discussion on Perl Monks.  Seemed
	more in line with what it does.

	Fixed several issues, particularly with =end and extra =pod sections.
	Thanks to Perl Monks Mr. Muskrat and dbwiz for pointing this out.

	You figure you have a nice test-suite.  But then you miss that each
	module loaded clears out the associated @INC entry  ;-(  Fixed now.
	Extra test now added.

	Added some more documentation.  Fixed problem with newlines being
	lost if there was a match on =begin WWWWW but without the code
	actually being activated.
