	Added further support needed for external autoloaders: specifically
	you can now call the "ifdef" code reference stored in @INC with a
	single parameter (module name) to obtain the underlying absolute path
	from which the module was actually loaded.  This was needed to support
	"load.pm".  Added some tests for this here as well.

	Added patches submitted by Konstantin Tokar.  Fixes problem with empty
	code blocks.  Removed using the "all" flag for inline comments: there's
	just too much code out there that would be activated unintentionally.

	Made checks for activation triggers a little more strict by adding a
	word boundary check at the end.

	Added functionality for doing one line activating comments.  Idea
	courtesy of Nick Kostirya.  Added documentation for it and some extra
	tests.

	Made sure test-suite cleans up even on multi-versioned systems.

	Moved the conversion logic to a subroutine.  It will have some effect
	on performance at the expense of better maintainability.  Sorry guys.
	This should allow for a more extensive functionality.

	Added an official API for AUTOLOADing modules: the "process", "reset"
	and "oneline" subroutines.

	Changed name to "ifdef" after a discussion on Perl Monks.  Seemed
	more in line with what it does.

	Fixed several issues, particularly with =end and extra =pod sections.
	Thanks to Perl Monks Mr. Muskrat and dbwiz for pointing this out.

	You figure you have a nice test-suite.  But then you miss that each
	module loaded clears out the associated @INC entry  ;-(  Fixed now.
	Extra test now added.

	Added some more documentation.  Fixed problem with newlines being
	lost if there was a match on =begin WWWWW but without the code
	actually being activated.

0.01	24 January 2004
	First public version of begin.pm.
