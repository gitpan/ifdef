=head1 NAME

ifdef - conditionally enable text within pod sections as code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  export DEBUGGING=1
  perl -Mifdef yourscript.pl

 or:

  perl -Mifdef=VERBOSE yourscript.pl

 or:

  perl -Mifdef=all yourscript.pl

 with:

  ======= yourscript.pl ================================================

  # code that's always compiled and executed

  =begin DEBUGGING

  warn "Only compiled and executed when DEBUGGING or 'all' enabled\n"

  =begin VERBOSE

  warn "Only compiled and executed when VERBOSE or 'all' enabled\n"

  =cut

  # code that's always compiled and executed

  # BEGINNING compiled and executed when BEGINNING enabled

  ======================================================================

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.08.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The "ifdef" pragma allows a developer to add sections of code that will be
compiled and executed only when the "ifdef" pragma is specifically enabled.
If the "ifdef" pragma is not enabled, then there is B<no> overhead involved
in either compilation of execution (other than the standard overhead of Perl
skipping =pod sections).

To prevent interference with other pod handlers, the name of the pod handler
B<must> be in uppercase.

If a =begin pod section is considered for replacement, then a scope is
created around that pod section so that there is no interference with any
of the code around it.  For example:

 my $foo= 2;

 =begin DEBUGGING

 my $foo= 1;
 warn "debug foo = $foo\n";

 =cut

 warn "normal foo = $foo\n";

is converted on the fly (before Perl compiles it) to:

 my $foo= 2;

 {

 my $foo= 1;
 warn "foo = $foo\n";

 }

 warn "normal foo = $foo\n";

But of course, this happens B<only> if the "ifdef" pragma is loaded B<and>
the environment variable B<DEBUGGING> is set.

As a shortcut for only single lines of code, you can also specify a single
line of code inside a commented line:

 # DEBUGGING print "we're in debugging mode now\n";

will only print the string "we're in debugging mode now\n" when the environment
variable B<DEBUGGING> is set.  Please note that the 'all' flag is ignored in
this case, as there is too much standard code out there that uses all uppercase
markers at the beginning of an inline comment which cause compile errors if
they would be enabled.

=head1 WHY?

One day, I finally had enough of always putting in and taking out debug
statements from modules I was developing.  I figured there had to be a
better way to do this.  Now, this module allows to leave debugging code
inside your programs and only have them come alive when I<you> want them
to be alive.  I<Without any run-time penalties when you're in production>.

=head1 REQUIRED MODULES

 Filter::Util::Call (any)
 IO::File (any)

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

This version is completely written in Perl.  It uses a source filter to
provide its magic to the script being run B<and> an @INC handler for all
of the modules that are loaded otherwise.  Because the pod directives are
ignored by Perl during normal compilation, the source filter is B<not> needed
for production use so there will be B<no> performance penalty in that case.

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Overhead during development

Because the "ifdef" pragma uses a source filter for the invoked script, and
an @INC handler for all further required files, there is an inherent overhead
for compiling Perl source code.  Not loading ifdef.pm at all, causes the normal
pod section ignoring functionality of Perl to come in place (without any added
overhead).

=head2 No changing of environment variables during execution

Since the "ifdef" pragma performs all of this magic at compile time, it
generally does not make sense to change the values of applicable environment
variables at execution, as there will be no compiled code available to
activate.

=head2 Modules that use AutoLoader, SelfLoader, load, etc.

For the moment, these modules bypass the mechanism of this module.  An
interface with load.pm is on the TODO list.  Patches for other autoloading
modules are welcomed.

=head2 Doesn't seem to work on mod_perl

Unfortunately, there still seem to be problems with getting this module to
work reliably under mod_perl.

=head2 API FOR AUTOLOADING MODULES

The following subroutines are available for doing your own processing, e.g.
for inclusion in your own AUTOLOADing modules.  The subroutines are B<not>
exported: if you want to use them in your own namespace, you will need to
import them yourself thusly:

 *myprocess = \&ifdef::process;

would import the "ifdef::process" subroutine as "myprocess" in your namespace..

=head3 process

 ifdef::process( $direct );

 $processed = ifdef::process( $original );

The "process" subroutine allows you process a given string of source code
and have it processed in the same manner as which the source filter / @INC
handler of "ifdef.pm" would do.

There are two modes of calling: if called in a void context, it will process
the string and put the result in place.  An alternate method allows you to
keep a copy: if called in scalar or list context, the processed string will
be returned.

See L</"oneline"> of you want to process line by line.

=head3 reset

 &ifdef::reset;

The "reset" subroutine is needed only if you're doing your own processing with
the L</"oneline"> subroutine.  It resets the internal variables so that no
state of previous calls to L</"process"> (or the internally called source
filter or @INC handler) will remain.

=head3 oneline

 &ifdef::oneline;

The "oneline" subroutine does just that: it process a single line of source
code.  The line of source to be processed is expected to be in B<$_>.  The
processed line will be stored in B<$_> as well.  So there are no input or
output parameters.

See L</"process"> of you want to a string consisting of many lines in one go.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Nick Kostirya for the idea of activating single line comments.

Konstantin Tokar for pointing out problems with empty code code blocks and
inline comments when the "all" flag was specified.  And providing patches!

=head1 RELATED MODULES

It would appear that Damian Conway's L<Smart::Comments> is scratching the
same itch I had when I implemented this module a long time ago.
